# sit

Introduction:
‘Sit’ is a simple, user-friendly meditation timer.  It works as a traditional countdown timer, with the option to add brief ‘interval’ alarms/reminders at timed spaces throughout the session. These serve as reminders to focus on the object of meditation.

On load the user sees 3 sliders: ‘Duration’, ‘Interval’, and ‘Sound’.

Duration:
The Duration slider sets the length of the main timer in minutes. It ranges from 5 to 30 minutes.

Interval:
The Interval timer sets the timing of spaced interval alarms to be heard during a session. When set to ‘5’, for example, the user will hear a brief sound/alarm every 5 minutes during the session. The Interval slider is set to ‘None’ by default.

Sound:
There are 3 sounds to choose from: Bell, Block, and Tone. Interval reminders will trigger a single instance or ‘hit’ of the selected sound. The final session alarm will trigger multiple instances of the selected sound to indicate the end of a session.

Track Progress:
Users can operate ‘Sit’ without logging in, but for those who wish to track their use over time it is possible to create an account. Once an account has been created the user has the option to ‘Track Progress’. Each session completed while logged in will be logged to the ‘Track Progress’ page. Each entry can be edited or deleted from the Progress Tracker.
